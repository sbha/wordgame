# new name: word game, letter game
# double points for words that use all seven letters
# sort option for word display - alpha rather than the default by length and alpha
# group 7 letter words by difficulty

# non-vowel base letter:
# choose a random non-vowel base or random over a certain threshold?



# Rules:

#
# find words with seven total letters and seven unique letters
# subsets of the all words of four letters or more that can be derived from the seven letter word
# vowel count
# 2 vowels (or more?)
# unique

# test for words that appear in a corpus

# select letter that must appear in every word
# select 7 letter unique anograms
# check for all 4-6 letter unique anograms that are a subset of the 7 letter unique anogram

# store correct entries
# store score
# display stored correct entries

# use only seven letter words with x number of derivaties
